		"description" : "Internal Weights:\n\n These layers help balance the factor oracle. Two factor oracles, one based on pitch and the other on chroma, run simultaneously and generate event candidates scored using the suffix length (LRS). This scoring system prioritizes outputs that maintain coherence with the selected feature. The candidates are then weighted using internal weights. If a candidate is proposed by both oracles, their respective weights are combined. The output is then chosen by applying a probability distribution to the candidates.\n\nExternal Weights:\n\nOnce candidates are generated, they can be further filtered based on influence, if enabled. This mechanism prioritizes outputs that match with specific features of the influence."

	"Temperature" : 	{
		"title" : "Temperature",
		"description" : "The temperature controls the softmax distribution used to select an output from the event candidates. A lower temperature favors higher LRS values, making them more likely to be chosen. A higher temperature results in a more uniform distribution. This can be used to avoid loops or to increase the overall value of Los"
